            <h2>Game Overview</h2>
            <p>BGMI is a battle royale game by Krafton, tailored for Indian players. Up to 100 players parachute onto a
                map, scavenging for weapons and supplies to survive and eliminate opponents. The play area shrinks over
                time, leading to intense encounters. BGMI, a rebranded version of PUBG Mobile, was relaunched in 2021
                after the original was banned in India in 2020. Players can compete solo, in duos, or squads, using
                various weapons, vehicles, and strategic air drops. The goal is to be the last player or team standing,
                earning the "Chicken Dinner."</p>
